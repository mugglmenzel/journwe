Developer Notes

* Facebook oAuth Hack: We use a slight modification of FacebookAuthProvider because we need to save the access_token, a feature which seems not to be supported in the oAuth plugin that we use. MUST add this line to conf/play.plugins:
10010:controllers.auth.oauth2.fb.FacebookAuthProvider
